# mobile first web design

to understand this concept, we will design the main typography of our files.

## the actual design

this approach is not only for css. this starts at the planning level. mobile devices allow less room than desktops, so the fonts must scale with the device.

### what *not* to do

## initial scss

your files should have a lot of css for all of the resets and base styles that you will change to develop into your brand's style. but for this example, just imagine a blank file. on the **left** you will see how you are expected to design your web pages with desktop to mobile responsive web design (rwd). on the **right** you will see how you are expected to design your web pages with mobile first responsive web deisgn. adopt the css on the *right* when you are organizing your files.
